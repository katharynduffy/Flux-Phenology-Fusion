First let's load some packages:

```{r, silent=TRUE}
library(phenocamapi)
library(plotly)
library(phenocamr)
library(dplyr)
```

Let's start by pulling in a list of sites that have AmeriFlux towers and PhenoCams via the phenocamapi package:

```{r}
phenos=get_phenos()
#and let's check the column names:
colnames(phenos)

```

Notice that 'flux_data' (true-false), 'flux_networks', and 'flux_sitenames' are all variables that you can either filter by or retain the info of.  Let's grab all Ameriflux sites where we have the sitename stored:
```{r}
phenos=phenos%>%
  filter(phenos$flux_data=='TRUE')%>%
filter(flux_networks_name=='AMERIFLUX')%>%
  filter(flux_sitenames!='NA')%>%
  select(flux_sitenames, site, date_first, date_last, site_description, primary_veg_type, koeppen_geiger)
head(phenos)
```
#external data from phenocamapi package
Now let's select two combination phenocam-flux tower sites from *different* plant functional types to explore (e.g. one grassland site and one evergreen needleleaf site)

```{r}
#example
GrassSites=phenos%>%
  filter(phenos$primary_veg_type=='GR')
head(GrassSites) #just viewing the top 6 sites in the dataframe

EvergreenSites=phenos%>%
  filter(phenos$primary_veg_type=='EN')
head(EvergreenSites)
```

```{r}
FirstGRSite=GrassSites[5, ] #I randomly chose a site in the table
FirstGRSite

SecondENSite=EvergreenSites[29,]
SecondENSite
```

Chose your own sites and build out your code chunk here:
```{r}
 #Copy and past the code above to select sites that you are interested in
#Drop your code here
```

[Koen Huffkens](https://khufkens.com/) developed the [phenocamr package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/phenocamr/index.html), which streamlines access to quality controlled data.  We will now use this package to download and process site based data according to a standardized methodology.

A full description of the methodology is provided in Scientific Data: Tracking vegetation phenology across diverse North American biomes using PhenoCam imagery (Richardson et al. 2018).

```{r}
#uncomment if you need to install via devtools
#if(!require(devtools)){install.package(devtools)}
#devtools::install_github("khufkens/phenocamr")
library(phenocamr)
```


Use the dataframe you built to feed the phenocamr package.
Note: you can choose either a daily or 3 day product

```{r}
phenocamr::download_phenocam(
  frequency = 3,
  veg_type = FirstGRSite$primary_veg_type,
  roi_id = 1000,
  site = FirstGRSite$site,
  phenophase = TRUE,
  out_dir = "."
  )

phenocamr::download_phenocam(
  frequency = 3,
  veg_type = SecondENSite$primary_veg_type,
  roi_id = 1000,
  site = SecondENSite$site,
  phenophase = TRUE,
  out_dir = "."
  )
```

Now look in your working directory.  You have data!  Read it in:

```{r}
# load the time series data but replace the csv filename with whatever you downloaded
df <- read.table("konza_GR_1000_3day.csv", header = TRUE, sep = ",")

# read in the transition date file
td <- read.table("konza_GR_1000_3day_transition_dates.csv",
                 header = TRUE,
                 sep = ",")
```

Let's take a look at the data:

```{r}
p = plot_ly() %>%
  add_trace(
  data = df,
  x = ~ as.Date(date),
  y = ~ smooth_gcc_90,
  name = 'Smoothed GCC',
  showlegend = TRUE,
  type = 'scatter',
  mode = 'line'
) %>% add_markers(
  data=df,
  x ~ as.Date(date),
  y = ~gcc_90,
  name = 'GCC',
  type = 'scatter',
  color ='#07A4B5', 
  opacity=.5
)
p
```

What patterns do you notice?  How would we go about determining say the start of spring? (SOS)

###Threshold values

Let's subset the transition date (td) for each year when 25% of the greenness amplitude (of the 90^th) percentile is reached (threshold_25).

```{r}
# select the rising (spring dates) for 25% threshold of Gcc 90
spring <- td[td$direction == "rising" & td$gcc_value == "gcc_90",]

```

Now let's create a simple plot_ly line graph of the smooth Green Chromatic Coordinate (Gcc) and add points for transition dates:


```{r}
p = plot_ly() %>%
  add_trace(
  data = df,
  x = ~ as.Date(date),
  y = ~ smooth_gcc_90,
  name = 'PhenoCam GCC',
  showlegend = TRUE,
  type = 'scatter',
  mode = 'line'
) %>% add_markers(
  data= spring, 
  x = ~ as.Date(spring$transition_25, origin = "1970-01-01"),
  y = ~ spring$threshold_25,
  type = 'scatter',
  mode = 'marker',
  name = 'Spring Dates')
                
p
```

Now we can see the transition date for each year of interest and the annual patterns of greenness.

However, if you want more control over the parameters used during processing, you can run through the three default processing steps as implemented in download_phenocam() and set parameters manually.

Of particular interest is the option to specify your own threshold used in determining transition dates. 

What would be a reasonable threshold for peak greenness?  Or autumn onset?  Look at the ts dataset and phenocamr package and come up with a threshold.  Use the same code to plot it here:

```{r}
#print('code here')
#some hint code
#what does 'rising' versus 'falling' denote?
#what threshold should you choose?
#td <- phenophases("konza_GR_1000_3day.csv",
#            internal = TRUE,
#            upper_thresh = 0.8)
fall <- td[td$direction == "falling" & td$gcc_value == "gcc_90",]
#Now generate a fall dataframe, what metrics should you use?
```



Let's load in a function to make plotting smoother.  I'm dropped it here in the markdown so that you can edit it and re-run it as you see fit:
```{r}
gcc_plot = function(gcc, spring, fall){
  unix = "1970-01-01"

  p = plot_ly(
    data = gcc,
    x = ~ date,
    y = ~ gcc_90,
    showlegend = FALSE,
    type = 'scatter',
    mode = 'markers'
  ) %>%
    add_trace(
      y = ~ smooth_gcc_90,
      mode = "lines",
      line = list(width = 2, color = "rgb(120,120,120)"),
      name = "Gcc loess fit",
      showlegend = TRUE
    ) %>%
    # SOS spring
    # 10%
    add_trace(
      data = spring,
      x = ~ as.Date(transition_10),
      y = ~ threshold_10,
      mode = "markers",
      type = "scatter",
      marker = list(color = "#7FFF00", symbol = "circle"),
      name = "SOS (10%)",
      showlegend = TRUE
    ) %>%
    add_segments(x = ~ as.Date(transition_10_lower_ci),
                 xend = ~ as.Date(transition_10_upper_ci),
                 # y = ~ 0,
                 # yend = ~ 1,
                 y = ~ threshold_10,
                 yend = ~ threshold_10,
                 line = list(color = "#7FFF00"),
                 name = "SOS (10%) - CI"
    ) %>%
    # 25 %
    add_trace(
      x = ~ as.Date(transition_25),
      y = ~ threshold_25,
      mode = "markers",
      type = "scatter",
      marker = list(color = "#66CD00", symbol = "square"),
      showlegend = TRUE,
      name = "SOS (25%)"
    ) %>%
    add_segments(x = ~ as.Date(transition_25_lower_ci),
                 xend = ~ as.Date(transition_25_upper_ci),
                 y = ~ threshold_25,
                 yend = ~ threshold_25,
                 line = list(color = "#66CD00"),
                 name = "SOS (25%) - CI"
    ) %>%
    # 50 %
    add_trace(
      x = ~ as.Date(transition_50),
      y = ~ threshold_50,
      mode = "markers",
      type = "scatter",
      marker = list(color = "#458B00", symbol = "diamond"),
      showlegend = TRUE,
      name = "SOS (50%)"
    ) %>%
    add_segments(x = ~ as.Date(transition_50_lower_ci),
                 xend = ~ as.Date(transition_50_upper_ci),
                 y = ~ threshold_50,
                 yend = ~ threshold_50,
                 line = list(color = "#458B00"),
                 name = "SOS (50%) - CI"
    ) %>%
    
    # EOS fall
    # 50%
    add_trace(
      data = fall,
      x = ~ as.Date(transition_50),
      y = ~ threshold_50,
      mode = "markers",
      type = "scatter",
      marker = list(color = "#FFB90F", symbol = "diamond"),
      showlegend = TRUE,
      name = "EOS (50%)"
    ) %>%
    add_segments(x = ~ as.Date(transition_50_lower_ci),
                 xend = ~ as.Date(transition_50_upper_ci),
                 y = ~ threshold_50,
                 yend = ~ threshold_50,
                 line = list(color = "#FFB90F"),
                 name = "EOS (50%) - CI"
    ) %>%
    # 25 %
    add_trace(
      x = ~ as.Date(transition_25),
      y = ~ threshold_25,
      mode = "markers",
      type = "scatter",
      marker = list(color = "#CD950C", symbol = "square"),
      showlegend = TRUE,
      name = "EOS (25%)"
    ) %>%
    add_segments(x = ~ as.Date(transition_25_lower_ci),
                 xend = ~ as.Date(transition_25_upper_ci),
                 y = ~ threshold_25,
                 yend = ~ threshold_25,
                 line = list(color = "#CD950C"),
                 name = "EOS (25%) - CI"
    ) %>%
    # 10 %
    add_trace(
      x = ~ as.Date(transition_10),
      y = ~ threshold_10,
      mode = "markers",
      marker = list(color = "#8B6508", symbol = "circle"),
      showlegend = TRUE,
      name = "EOS (10%)"
    ) %>%
    add_segments(x = ~ as.Date(transition_10_lower_ci),
                 xend = ~ as.Date(transition_10_upper_ci),
                 y = ~ threshold_10,
                 yend = ~ threshold_10,
                 line = list(color = "#8B6508"),
                 name = "EOS (10%) - CI"
    )
  return (p)
}

```

```{r}

gr1 = gcc_plot(df, spring, fall)
gr1
```

Now let's look at inter-annual variation in spring onset.  What is the difference in 25% greenness onset for your first site? #hint, look at the spring dataframe you just generated

```{r}
#some hints to get you started
yr=spring$transition_25
yr=as.Date(yr)
yr
```

```{r}
#pull out spring transition dates into separate columns
dates_split <- data.frame(date = yr,
                 year = as.numeric(format(yr, format = "%Y")),
                 month = as.numeric(format(yr, format = "%m")),
                 day = as.numeric(format(yr, format = "%d")))

#or track DOY changes
doy=as.Date(yr, format='%d%m%Y')
doy=lubridate::yday(doy)
doy
doy=as.data.frame(doy)
spring_variation=cbind(yr, doy)
```
```{r}
 p = plot_ly(
    data = spring_variation,
    x = ~ yr,
    y = ~ doy,
    showlegend = FALSE,
    type = 'scatter',
    mode = 'markers', 
    name = "Year"
  ) %>%
    # 25 %
    add_trace(
      x = ~ yr,
      mode = "lines",
      line = list(width = 2, color = "rgb(120,120,120)"),
      showlegend = FALSE
      
    )
p
```

###Comparing phenology of the same vegetation cover but across climate space

As Dr. Richardson mentioned this morning in his introduction lecture, the same plant functional types (e.g. grasslands) can have very different phenological cycles.  Let's pick two phenocam grassland sites: one from a tropical climate (kamuela), and one from an arid climate #edit

```{r}
SecondGRSite=GrassSites[4,]
phenocamr::download_phenocam(
  frequency = 3,
  veg_type = SecondGRSite$primary_veg_type,
  roi_id = 1000,
  site = SecondGRSite$site,
  phenophase = TRUE,
  out_dir = "."
  )
```

Now use the code you've generated above to pull in data from those sites:

```{r}
#code here
# load the time series data but replace the csv filename with whatever you downloaded
df <- read.table("kendall_GR_1000_3day.csv", header = TRUE, sep = ",")

# read in the transition date file
td <- read.table("kendall_GR_1000_3day_transition_dates.csv",
                 header = TRUE,
                 sep = ",")
spring <- td[td$direction == "rising" & td$gcc_value == "gcc_90",]
gr2 = gcc_plot(df, spring, fall)
gr2
```

Now let's create a subplot of your grasslands to compare phenology, some hint code below:

```{r}
#some hint code for subplotting in plot_ly:
p <- subplot(gr1, gr2, nrows=2)
p
```

Once you have a subplot of grassland phenology across 2 climates answer the following questions here in the markdown:
1. What seasonal patterns do you see?
2. Do you think you set your thresholds correctly for transition dates/phenophases?  How might that very as a function of climate?




***
##Flux Data Integration

Finally, let's use Bijan's package to pull in AmeriFlux data:
```{r}
fluxfile <- system.file('fluxnetrepo/FLX_US-Me2/FLX_US-Me2_FULLSET_DD.csv', package = 'phenocamapi')

fluxts <- read.csv(fluxfile, skip = 0)
fluxts[fluxts==-9999] <- NA
fluxts <- as.data.table(fluxts)
fluxts[,datetime:=as.POSIXct(as.character(TIMESTAMP), format='%Y%m%d')]
fluxts[,YYYYMMDD:=as.character(as.Date(datetime))]
fluxts[,YEAR:=year(datetime)]
fluxts[,DOY:=yday(datetime)]

head(fluxts[, .(TIMESTAMP, TA_F)])
```

Let's read in the phenocam data for that fluxtower and plot it:
```{r}
# load the time series data but replace the csv filename with whatever you downloaded
df <- read.table("oregonMP_EN_1000_3day.csv", header = TRUE, sep = ",")

# read in the transition date file
td <- read.table("oregonMP_EN_1000_3day_transition_dates.csv",
                 header = TRUE,
                 sep = ",")
spring <- td[td$direction == "rising" & td$gcc_value == "gcc_90",]
fall <- td[td$direction == "falling" & td$gcc_value == "gcc_90",]
gcc_p = gcc_plot(df, spring, fall)
gcc_p
```
Now let's look at the flux data:
```{r}
p = plot_ly(
    data = fluxts,
    x = ~ datetime,
    y = ~ GPP_DT_CUT_MEAN,
    showlegend = FALSE,
    type = 'scatter',
    mode = 'markers'
  ) 
p
```

We'll need to filter the phenocam data to match up with the fluxtower subset:
```{r}
sum(is.element(df$date, as.factor(fluxts$datetime)))
sum(is.element(df$date, as.factor(fluxts$datetime)))
```
Unfortunately our flux tower data is too short to see much of an overlap, but here's where your data could come in!  Below I've dropped some code to subplot fluxtower and phenocam data, if you have time during this workshop feel free to drag your data and code from above to complete a GPP/GCC comparison.

```{r}
#some hint code for subplotting in plot_ly:
p1 = plot_ly(
    data = df,
    x = ~ date,
    y = ~ gcc_90,
    showlegend = FALSE,
    type = 'scatter',
    mode = 'markers'
  ) %>%
    add_trace(
      y = ~ smooth_gcc_90,
      mode = "lines",
      line = list(width = 2, color = "rgb(120,120,120)"),
      name = "Gcc loess fit",
      showlegend = TRUE
    )
p1
```

```{r}
#some hint code for subplotting in plot_ly:
#p <- subplot(p1, p2, nrows=2)
#p
```

You’ve now been introduced to the basics of working with the PhenoCam API, using the PhenoR package, and integrating PhenoCam and AmeriFlux data. Good luck conducting your own analyses!
